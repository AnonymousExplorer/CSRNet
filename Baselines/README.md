# Get baselines codes and models

Most of our baselines' code are available in: https://lmi.fe.uni-lj.si/en/research/fh/

Also we use DIC official code:[DIC](https://github.com/Maclory/Deep-Iterative-Collaboration) to reproduce experiments and the model weights are avaiable in the [Baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vZH1Wvg-rfC6e0ckP6rQ1g?pwd=y7ns).

PCRCN and RCNet weights are also available in the  [Baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vZH1Wvg-rfC6e0ckP6rQ1g?pwd=y7ns).

- The reproduced RCNet is not as good as its paper claimed. It may be that there is a problem with the details of the paper. When reproducing the model, it is found that the output channel of the pixel shuffle layer in the paper does not match the input of the next layer.
